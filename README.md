Hey guys, thank you for allowing me to work on this. Listen, Github pages isn't allowing my javascript to load, so if you want to see the few things I wrote, you'll have to clone the repository and load it locally. Just wanted to mention that. Overall, it seems to be done. Please let me know if you would like to see any improvements.
